# ðŸ§ª Mock Custody System Test

## What I Fixed

The custody process was failing because it was trying to call a Firebase Cloud Function that doesn't exist:

- **Before**: Called real bot trading API â†’ Failed
- **After**: Uses mock custody system â†’ Works for testing

## ðŸ”§ Mock Custody System

The mock system simulates the real custody process:

1. **Friend Request Sent** (2 seconds)
2. **Friend Accepted** (2 seconds)
3. **Pet Received** (2 seconds)
4. **Custody Complete** (calls `onCustodyComplete`)

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### **Step 1: Test Sell Request Creation**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login/Register as a user
3. Go to "Sell" page
4. Fill out pet form:
   - Name: "Test Dragon"
   - Type: "Dragon"
   - Rarity: "rare"
   - Age: "full-grown"
   - Price: "100"
   - Description: "A beautiful test dragon"
5. Upload an image
6. Click "Submit for Custody"

### **Step 2: Test Mock Custody Process**

1. Click "Start Pet Custody"
2. **Expected**: Should show "Friend request sent" page
3. **Wait 2 seconds**: Should automatically move to "Friend accepted"
4. **Wait 2 more seconds**: Should move to "Waiting for trade"
5. **Wait 2 more seconds**: Should move to "Verifying pet"
6. **Wait 2 more seconds**: Should show "Custody Complete" with success message

### **Step 3: Verify Sell Request Creation**

1. Check browser console for debug logs:
   - "Starting mock custody process for testing..."
   - "Mock custody data created: ..."
   - "Custody completed with data: ..."
   - "Creating sell request with data: ..."
   - "Sell request created with ID: ..."
2. **Expected**: Should see "Sell request created successfully!" alert
3. **Expected**: Should navigate to dashboard

### **Step 4: Test Admin Dashboard**

1. Go to `http://localhost:8088`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Go to "Sell Requests" page
4. **Expected**: Should see the sell request from Step 1-3

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

- âœ… No more "Custody Failed" errors
- âœ… Mock custody process completes successfully
- âœ… Sell request is created in Firebase
- âœ… Admin dashboard shows the sell request
- âœ… Console shows debug information
- âœ… No ESLint warnings

## ðŸ”„ Real vs Mock System

### **Real System** (when bot API is available):

- Calls Firebase Cloud Function
- Real bot sends friend request
- Real trading process
- Real pet verification

### **Mock System** (for testing):

- Simulates all steps with timeouts
- No real bot interaction
- Perfect for development/testing
- Same data structure as real system

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Test the complete workflow** using the mock system
2. **Verify sell requests appear** in admin dashboard
3. **Test admin approval process**
4. **When ready for production**, replace mock with real bot API

The mock system allows you to test the entire sell request workflow without needing the actual bot trading infrastructure! ðŸŽ‰
